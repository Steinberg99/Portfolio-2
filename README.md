# Lazy Portfolio!

This repository hosts a small webapp that displays information from GitHub profiles. Users can enter their own username in the url or search for their profile with the search bar. This way they can create their own "lazy" portfolio page.

## Description

Welcome! For the first project of the minor [Web Design and Development](https://everythingweb.org/) we had to create a small portfolio page that used the GitHub api. I thought it would be fun to create a portfolio page that could be used by multiple people. On the site users can enter their own GitHub handle to customize the page based on their accounts.
